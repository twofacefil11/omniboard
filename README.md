Welcome to this small project of mine.

Its purpose is to gain experience, learn and to have fun.

It's a simple client-side gameboard enviourment, where you are free to play classic board strategy games (like checkers) with the skewed ruleset your ol' granny got you used to.

Or no rules at all for what I care.

I don't expect it to be perfect any time soon c;
